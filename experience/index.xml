      <description>OneCell is a digital pathology platform with an AI system, scanning hardware, and smart storage that helps save lives.
Here I took part in building a huge backend system that can handle enormous amount of imaging content. Platform core architecture is built by me and then evolved by our team.
My achievements: Designed/developed the MVP of the digital pathology backend in 2 months. Split a huge monorepo of modules into independent repositories to allow separate versioning of microservices with the help of Git history rewriting tools.</description>

      <description>I started my professional path as a Java Developer on a Spring stack in a distributed team in Grid Dynamics.
I&amp;rsquo;ve took part in the development of a batch system that accumulates customer data from various sources, processes it and provides it to other systems. System processed hundreds and thousands of messages per second and processing should&amp;rsquo;ve been written with performance and data integrity in mind.
Here I improved my skills by taking relevant courses as a part of my career development in the company.</description>

      <description>This is my first long-term project on a freelance that I built.
I designed and built an interactive map (based on Google Maps) with taxi drivers, their prices and total calculation. Also implemented a taxi driver panel with meter and GPS tracker.
Customers are supposed to open a website, choose nearest taxi-driver, see if full price is OK for them and call the driver directly.</description>
