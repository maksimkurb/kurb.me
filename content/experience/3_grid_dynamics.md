I started my professional path as a Java Developer on a Spring stack in a distributed team in Grid Dynamics.

I've took part in the development of a batch system that accumulates customer data from various sources, processes it and provides it to other systems.
System processed hundreds and thousands of messages per second and processing should've been written with performance and data integrity in mind.

Also I improved my skills here by taking relevant courses as a part of my career development in the company.

- Developed backend components and implemented unit test cases under the guidance of the senior developer, achieving 85% code coverage and passing all quality gates.
- Conducted peer code reviews using Git workflow processes, identifying 15+ potential bugs and improving team code quality standards.
- Created and presented technical demos to stakeholders in the international team every week following the Scrum methodology.
