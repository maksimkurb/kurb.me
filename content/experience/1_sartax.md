This is my first long-term project on a freelance that I built.

I designed and built an interactive map (based on Google Maps) with taxi drivers, their prices and total calculation.
Also implemented a taxi driver panel with meter and GPS tracker.

Customers are supposed to open a website, choose nearest taxi-driver, see if full price is OK for them and call the driver directly.
