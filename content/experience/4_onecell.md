{{% a_blank "OneCell" "https://onecell.ai/en" %}} is a digital pathology platform with an AI system, scanning hardware, and smart storage that helps save lives.

Here I took part in building a huge backend system that can handle enormous amount of imaging content.
Platform core architecture is built by me and then evolved by our team.


#### My achievements:
- Designed and developed the MVP of the platform backend within a 2-month timeframe.
- Restructured a monorepo with modules into 10+ independent repositories for separate versioning of microservices, ensuring correct Git history rewriting.
- Mentored and coached 2 colleagues on the team.
- Enhanced the Notion workspace, streamlining task management and optimizing team collaboration.
