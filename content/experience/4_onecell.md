{{% a_blank "OneCell" "https://onecell.ai/en" %}} is a digital pathology platform with an AI system, scanning hardware, and smart storage that helps save lives.

Here I took part in building a huge backend system that can handle enormous amount of imaging content.
Platform core architecture is built by me and then evolved by our team.


#### My achievements:
- Designed/developed the MVP of the digital pathology backend in 2 months.
- Split a huge monorepo of modules into independent repositories to allow separate versioning of microservices with the help of Git history rewriting tools.
- Mentored 2 colleagues on the team.
- Improved the Notion workspace to make it easier for the whole team to work on their own tasks.
