{{% a_blank "OneCell" "https://www.onecell.ai/en" %}} is a digital pathology platform with an AI system, scanning hardware, and smart storage that helps save lives.

Here I took part in building a huge backend system that can handle enormous amount of imaging content.
Platform core architecture is built by me and then evolved by our team.


#### My achievements:
- Delivered complete MVP platform backend within aggressive 2-month deadline, enabling company to launch to first customers.
- Restructured monolithic repository into 10+ separate microservice repositories, enabling independent versioning and reducing deployment conflicts by 80%.
- Coached 2 team members on backend architecture and Java best practices, improving code quality scores and reducing bug reports.
