{{% a_blank "OneCell" "https://www.onecell.ai/en" %}} is a digital pathology platform with an AI system, scanning hardware, and smart storage that helps save lives.

I was promoted to Senior Software Developer in OneCell since I've already performed the duties of this position.
I coached colleagues from my team and worked with customers' staff to integrate our systems.


#### My achievements:
- Developed a new file storage approach that reduced storage and computational costs by 50%, optimizing resource utilization across the platform infrastructure.
- Reduced client integration time on backend side by 10x by implementing a highly configurable API approach, accelerating customer onboarding and increasing sales velocity.
- Mentored 3 junior engineers, accelerating their technical growth and reducing team onboarding time by 40%.
- Implemented automated code generation for client-server APIs with distributed tracing, reducing manual development effort and improving system observability.
