I built a system for checking individuals and legal entities for risk factors.
System aggregates information from various sources and generates reports by operator request, consisting of real-time APIs and APIs with queue processing.

Bank security team used that app to check individuals before approving loan issuance.

#### My achievements:
- Built complete system architecture from scratch including backend services and frontend interface, launching production-ready application within 6 months.
- Integrated several third-party background check APIs, automating manual verification processes and reducing processing time from 48 hours to 15 minutes.
- Developed OAuth provider and public API infrastructure, enabling external partners to integrate seamlessly.
