I built a system for checking individuals and legal entities for risk factors.
System aggregates information from various sources and generates reports by operator request, consisting of real-time APIs and APIs with queue processing.

Bank security team used that app to check individuals before approving loan issuance.

#### My achievements:
- Developed backend and frontend for system from scratch.
- Integrated with 3 third-party systems to perform background checks on individuals.
- Implemented OAuth provider and public API for seamless integration with our service.
